## DaphneBenchmark
This is a extended part of the [DaphneBenchmark Suite](https://github.com/esa-tu-darmstadt/daphne-benchmark). As mentioned within the paper, we are specifically interested in the eucledian clustering implementation. Testing can be done with medium size dataset in this respository or other sizes in the original.
